RF Switch

The **RF Switch** feature allows you to toggle between the built-in ceramic antenna and an external antenna by configuring `GPIO14` . To enable this function, *you must first set `GPIO3` to a low level* , as this activates the RF switch control.

- **GPIO14 Low Level (Default Setting)** : The device uses the built-in ceramic antenna.

- **GPIO14 High Level** : The device switches to the external antenna.

By default, `GPIO14` is set to a low level, enabling the built-in antenna. To use an external antenna, set `GPIO14` to a high level. Refer to the example code below for guidance on configuring `GPIO3` and `GPIO14` to activate the external antenna:

```cpp

void setup() {

  pinMode(WIFI_ENABLE, OUTPUT); // pinMode(3, OUTPUT);

  digitalWrite(WIFI_ENABLE, LOW); // digitalWrite(3, LOW); // Activate RF switch control

  delay(100);

  pinMode(WIFI_ANT_CONFIG, OUTPUT); // pinMode(14, OUTPUT);

  digitalWrite(WIFI_ANT_CONFIG, HIGH); // digitalWrite(14, HIGH); // Use external antenna

}

```

## Getting started

To enable you to get started with the XIAO ESP32C6 faster, please read the hardware and software preparation below to prepare the XIAO.

### Hardware Preparation

You need to prepare the following:

- 1 x [Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32C6]([https://www.seeedstudio.com/Seeed-Studio-XIAO-ESP32C6-p-5884.html](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Seeed-Studio-XIAO-ESP32C6-p-5884.html))

- 1 x Computer

- 1 x USB Type-C cable

tip

Some USB cables can only supply power and cannot transfer data. If you don't have a USB cable or don't know if your USB cable can transmit data, you can check [Seeed USB Type-C support USB 3.1]([https://www.seeedstudio.com/USB-3-1-Type-C-to-A-Cable-1-Meter-3-1A-p-4085.html](https://www.seeedstudio.com/USB-3-1-Type-C-to-A-Cable-1-Meter-3-1A-p-4085.html)) .

#### Solder header

XIAO ESP32C6 is shipped without pin headers by default, you need to prepare your own pin headers and solder it to the corresponding pins of XIAO so that you can connect to the expansion board or sensor.

Due to the miniature size of XIAO ESP32C6, please be careful when soldering headers, do not stick different pins together, and do not stick solder to the shield or other components. Otherwise, it may cause XIAO to short circuit or not work properly, and the consequences caused by this will be borne by the user.

#### BootLoader Mode

There are times when we use the wrong program to make XIAO appear to lose ports or not work properly. The specific performance is:

- Connected to computer, but no port number found for XIAO.

- The computer is connected and the port number appears, but the upload program fails.

When you encounter the above two situations, you can try to put XIAO into BootLoader mode, which can solve most of the problems of unrecognized devices and failed uploads. The specific method is:

- **Step 1** . Press and hold the BOOT button on the XIAO ESP32C6 without releasing it.

- **Step 2** . Keep the BOOT button pressed and then connect to the computer via the data cable. Release the BOOT button after connecting to the computer.

- **Step 3** . Upload the **Blink** program to check the operation of the XIAO ESP32C6.

#### Reset

When the program runs abnormally, you can press Reset once during power-up to let XIAO re-execute the uploaded program.

When you press and hold the BOOT key while powering up and then press the Reset key once, you can also enter BootLoader mode.

### Software Preparation

The recommended programming tool for the XIAO ESP32C6 is the Arduino IDE, so you need to complete the Arduino installation as part of the software preparation.

## Battery Usage

The XIAO ESP32C6 series features a built-in power management chip, allowing it to be powered independently by a battery or to charge the battery through its USB port.

For connecting a battery to your XIAO, we recommend using a qualified rechargeable 3.7V lithium battery. When soldering the battery, carefully distinguish between the positive and negative terminals. The negative electrode pad should be located on the left side near the silk screen marking "D8," while the positive electrode pad should be located on the right side near the silk screen marking "D5."

caution

When using battery power, no voltage will be present on the 5V pin.

Red Indicator Light

The XIAO ESP32C6 has a red indicator light for battery charging, similar to the [XIAO ESP32S3](/xiao_esp32s3_getting_started/#battery-usage) :

The red light behavior for the XIAO ESP32C6 is as follows:

- When no battery is connected:

- The red light turns on when the Type-C cable is connected and turns off after 30 seconds.

- When a battery is connected and the Type-C cable is plugged in for charging:

- The red light flashes.

- When the battery is fully charged via the Type-C connection:

- The red light turns off.

## Reading Battery Voltage

To monitor the battery voltage on the XIAO ESP32C6, similar to the [XIAO ESP32C3](/XIAO_ESP32C3_Getting_Started/#check-the-battery-voltage) , you'll need to solder a 200k resistor in a 1:2 configuration. This setup reduces the voltage by half, allowing safe monitoring through the A0 analog port.

### Sample Code

The code below initializes the ADC on the A0 port and averages 16 readings to calculate the battery voltage, adjusting for the 1:2 attenuation ratio of the voltage divider.

```cpp

#include &lt;Arduino.h&gt;

void setup() {

  Serial.begin(115200);

  pinMode(A0, INPUT);         // Configure A0 as ADC input

}

void loop() {

  uint32_t Vbatt = 0;

  for(int i = 0; i &lt; 16; i++) {

    Vbatt += analogReadMilliVolts(A0); // Read and accumulate ADC voltage

  }

  float Vbattf = 2 * Vbatt / 16 / 1000.0;     // Adjust for 1:2 divider and convert to volts

  Serial.println(Vbattf, 3);                  // Output voltage to 3 decimal places

  delay(1000);                                // Wait for 1 second

}

```

This code takes 16 measurements from the ADC, averages them, and then compensates for the voltage divider's 1:2 ratio to output the battery voltage in volts with three decimal places of precision.

## Deep sleep mode and wake-up

The XIAO ESP32C6 has a complete deep sleep mode and wake-up function. Here we will show two of the more common examples offered by the ESP.

### Demo1: Deep Sleep with External Wake Up

This code displays how to use deep sleep with an external trigger as a wake up source and how to store data in RTC memory to use it over reboots.

```cpp

/*

Hardware Connections

======================

Push Button to GPIO 0 pulled down with a 10K Ohm

resistor

NOTE:

======

Bit mask of GPIO numbers which will cause wakeup. Only GPIOs

which have RTC functionality can be used in this bit map.

For different SoCs, the related GPIOs are:

- ESP32: 0, 2, 4, 12-15, 25-27, 32-39

- ESP32-S2: 0-21

- ESP32-S3: 0-21

- ESP32-C6: 0-7

- ESP32-H2: 7-14

*/

#define BUTTON_PIN_BITMASK (1ULL &lt;&lt; GPIO_NUM_0) // GPIO 0 bitmask for ext1

RTC_DATA_ATTR int bootCount = 0;

/*

Method to print the reason by which ESP32

has been awaken from sleep

*/

void print_wakeup_reason(){

  esp_sleep_wakeup_cause_t wakeup_reason;

  wakeup_reason = esp_sleep_get_wakeup_cause();

  switch(wakeup_reason)

  {

    case ESP_SLEEP_WAKEUP_EXT0 : Serial.println("Wakeup caused by external signal using RTC_IO"); break;

    case ESP_SLEEP_WAKEUP_EXT1 : Serial.println("Wakeup caused by external signal using RTC_CNTL"); break;

    case ESP_SLEEP_WAKEUP_TIMER : Serial.println("Wakeup caused by timer"); break;

    case ESP_SLEEP_WAKEUP_TOUCHPAD : Serial.println("Wakeup caused by touchpad"); break;

    case ESP_SLEEP_WAKEUP_ULP : Serial.println("Wakeup caused by ULP program"); break;

    default : Serial.printf("Wakeup was not caused by deep sleep: %d\n",wakeup_reason); break;

  }

}

void setup(){

  Serial.begin(115200);

  delay(1000); //Take some time to open up the Serial Monitor

  //Increment boot number and print it every reboot

  ++bootCount;

  Serial.println("Boot number: " + String(bootCount));

  //Print the wakeup reason for ESP32

  print_wakeup_reason();

  /*

  First we configure the wake up source

  We set our ESP32 to wake up for an external trigger.

  There are two types for ESP32, ext0 and ext1, ext0 

  don't support ESP32C6 so we use ext1.

  */

  //If you were to use ext1, you would use it like

  esp_sleep_enable_ext1_wakeup(BUTTON_PIN_BITMASK,ESP_EXT1_WAKEUP_ANY_HIGH);

  //Go to sleep now

  Serial.println("Going to sleep now");

  esp_deep_sleep_start();

  Serial.println("This will never be printed");

}

void loop(){

  //This is not going to be called

}

```

### Demo2: Deep Sleep with Timer Wake Up

ESP32 offers a deep sleep mode for effective power saving as power is an important factor for IoT applications. In this mode CPUs, most of the RAM, and all the digital peripherals which are clocked from APB_CLK are powered off. The only parts of the chip which can still be powered on are: RTC controller, RTC peripherals ,and RTC memories.

This code displays the most basic deep sleep with a timer to wake it up and how to store data in RTC memory to use it over reboots.

```cpp

/*

#define uS_TO_S_FACTOR 1000000ULL  /* Conversion factor for micro seconds to seconds */

#define TIME_TO_SLEEP  5        /* Time ESP32 will go to sleep (in seconds) */

RTC_DATA_ATTR int bootCount = 0;

/*

*/

void print_wakeup_reason(){

  esp_sleep_wakeup_cause_t wakeup_reason;

  wakeup_reason = esp_sleep_get_wakeup_cause();

  switch(wakeup_reason)

  {

    case ESP_SLEEP_WAKEUP_EXT0 : Serial.println("Wakeup caused by external signal using RTC_IO"); break;

    case ESP_SLEEP_WAKEUP_EXT1 : Serial.println("Wakeup caused by external signal using RTC_CNTL"); break;

    case ESP_SLEEP_WAKEUP_TIMER : Serial.println("Wakeup caused by timer"); break;

    case ESP_SLEEP_WAKEUP_TOUCHPAD : Serial.println("Wakeup caused by touchpad"); break;

    case ESP_SLEEP_WAKEUP_ULP : Serial.println("Wakeup caused by ULP program"); break;

    default : Serial.printf("Wakeup was not caused by deep sleep: %d\n",wakeup_reason); break;

  }

}

void setup(){

  Serial.begin(115200);

  delay(1000); //Take some time to open up the Serial Monitor

  //Increment boot number and print it every reboot

  ++bootCount;

  Serial.println("Boot number: " + String(bootCount));

  //Print the wakeup reason for ESP32

  print_wakeup_reason();

  /*

  First we configure the wake up source

  We set our ESP32 to wake up every 5 seconds

  */

  esp_sleep_enable_timer_wakeup(TIME_TO_SLEEP * uS_TO_S_FACTOR);

  Serial.println("Setup ESP32 to sleep for every " + String(TIME_TO_SLEEP) +

  " Seconds");

  /*

  Next we decide what all peripherals to shut down/keep on

  By default, ESP32 will automatically power down the peripherals

  not needed by the wakeup source, but if you want to be a poweruser

  this is for you. Read in detail at the API docs

  [http://esp-idf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api-reference/system/deep_sleep.html](http://esp-idf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api-reference/system/deep_sleep.html)

  Left the line commented as an example of how to configure peripherals.

  The line below turns off all RTC peripherals in deep sleep.

  */

  //esp_deep_sleep_pd_config(ESP_PD_DOMAIN_RTC_PERIPH, ESP_PD_OPTION_OFF);

  //Serial.println("Configured all RTC Peripherals to be powered down in sleep");

  /*

  Now that we have setup a wake cause and if needed setup the

  peripherals state in deep sleep, we can now start going to

  deep sleep.

  In the case that no wake up sources were provided but deep

  sleep was started, it will sleep forever unless hardware

  reset occurs.

  */

  Serial.println("Going to sleep now");

  Serial.flush(); 

  esp_deep_sleep_start();

  Serial.println("This will never be printed");

}

void loop(){

  //This is not going to be called

}

```

tip

If you want to learn to use more of the deep sleep mode and wake-up functions, you can find more sample programs officially written for the chip by ESP in the Arduino IDE.
